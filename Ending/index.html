          The light flickers. The strange interface dissolves into static, then darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          You blink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your room is exactly the same as before. The same coffee cup.
          The same open notes. The laptop shows your normal desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clock reads <b>11:58 PM</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was it all just a dream? A stressed-out brain inventing time travel to escape?
          Or your mind showing you how much your choices about time really matter?
        </p>
        <p>
          You stretch, close a few distracting tabs, and reopen your notes.
          The exam is still tomorrow. You can't time travel—but you can still change tomorrow
          by what you do now.
