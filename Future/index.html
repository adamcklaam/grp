          Dates and icons rush past your eyes like a tunnel of notifications.
          Everything slams to a stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your room looks the same, but the light is different. Your phone says:
          <b>Tomorrow, 10:14 AM</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          On your laptop, the grades page is already open. One course is highlighted,
          waiting for you to click.
        </p>
        <p>
          You move the cursor. Your result appears on the screen.
          You pass the exam and got a pretty good grade.
        </p>
        <p>
          It feels strange. You don't remember the questions.
          You don't remember answering anything. You just jumped here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relief doesn't feel like it belongs to you.
          It's like watching someone else's life from the outside.
